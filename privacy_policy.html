FOOTBALL DNA TEST — PRIVACY POLICY

Last updated: [5 December 2025]

Welcome to Football DNA Test.
This Privacy Policy explains how our app works and what information is (and is not) collected. The app is designed to be simple and fun, and we take special care because many users may be children.

1. Information We Collect

The Football DNA Test app does not collect, store, or share any personal information about users.

We do not:

Ask for names

Ask for email addresses

Track your location

Create user accounts

Collect photos

Store quiz answers

Your quiz responses stay on your device only and are not sent to us.

2. Third-Party Services (AdMob)

The app uses Google AdMob to show ads.

AdMob may automatically collect some device information to display and personalize ads (for example: device model, approximate location, interactions with ads).

This data is collected by Google, not by us.

You can learn more about how Google uses information here:

For users in regions requiring consent (such as the EU), Google may show a consent message depending on your device.

3. Children’s Privacy

Because this app may be used by children, we make sure:

We do not collect personal information.

We only use Google-certified ad networks.

No data is collected by us that can identify your child.

If you believe a child has provided personal information to us by mistake, please contact us and we will assist.

4. Data Storage

We do not store any user data on servers.
All gameplay happens offline on your device.
